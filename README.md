# Kaggle-DonorsChoose-Application
It is a project on kaggle DonorsChoose.org prediction, which applies a lot of nltk and nlp knowledge.
The model might need 140 mins to train the nlp model and do predictions on kaggle, score was 0.77703(top 40%).

Since I can't upload the whole training and test dataset onto GitHub, please refer to kaggle for the code running: https://www.kaggle.com/bogikidd/nltk-and-gru-on-donorschoose-org

Will do some more data engineering to try to make the prediction better in the near future
